                JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It
                is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for
                example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of
                its environment to provide programmatic control over them. JavaScript
                contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math,
                and a core set of language elements such as operators, control
                structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a
                variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for
                example:
            <ul>
                <li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its
                    Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place
                    elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page
                    navigation</li> JavaScript extends the core language by supplying
                <li>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript
                    on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a
                    database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or
                    perform file manipulations on a server.</li>
